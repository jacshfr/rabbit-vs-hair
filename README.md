rabbit-vs-hair
==============

A classic race between two polar opposites



Declared 3 variables - distance, boolean, and some math to process fatigue

Made method to store values for each key put in

Assigned values to keys

Started the loop

If/elseif statement to check to see if someone had crossed the finish line

Else statement ends with calling run function on animals to begin the race


Referenced Codecademy.com Dragon Slayer Game for Math and remembering how to work the loops.
